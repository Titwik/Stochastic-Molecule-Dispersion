Modelled a molecule dispersing into a compartment-based system in Python. This was done for my Stochastic Modelling in Biology module at university and made use of the Chemical Master Equation, as well as dividing the 1D axis into compartments in order to count how many molecules are in each compartment after a set amount of time.
